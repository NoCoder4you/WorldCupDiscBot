              <h2>2. Overview - How It Works</h2>

              <h3>2.1 Entry Fee Collection</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>All participants (“Players”) must pay a one-time, non-recurring entry fee, set as a specified amount of Habbo credits, prior to the stated entry deadline.</li>
                <li>The entry fee amount will be disclosed via the official Google registration form and a pinned server message. If there is any discrepancy, the pinned server message prevails.</li>
                <li>Entry fees are pooled to fund the prize pool and may be subject to reasonable tax, platform, or administrative deductions where applicable.</li>
                <li>No discounts, waivers, substitutions, or alternative forms of entry are permitted.</li>
                <li>Entry fees are strictly non-refundable once paid.</li>
                <li>Entry closes at 23:59 UTC on INPUT DATE. No new Players shall be accepted after the official kick-off.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>2.2 Team Draw</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Each confirmed Player is randomly assigned one (1) national team by the bot following the close of the entry period.</li>
                <li>The assignment process is automated and impartial. No manual bias, weighting, preference, or selective treatment is applied.</li>
                <li>Final team assignment may be deferred until all forty-eight (48) national teams have been purchased by Players.</li>
                <li>Draw results may be published in a dedicated server channel for transparency and audit, including machine-readable files such as JSON.</li>
                <li>Publication of the draw constitutes official confirmation of assignment.</li>
                <li>Assignments are final upon publication and may not be swapped except via explicitly bot-sanctioned mechanisms defined elsewhere.</li>
                <li>All teams commence on equal terms provided all 48 teams are allocated before the opening match.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>2.3 Team Reveal</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Assigned teams will be revealed via an official Referee announcement embed no later than one (1) week prior to kick-off.</li>
                <li>Nicknames and roles may be updated for visibility, subject to platform limits.</li>
                <li>DMs may be sent confirming assignments; failure to receive a DM does not invalidate assignment.</li>
                <li>Referee announcement and published records take precedence over nickname/role/DM indicators.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>2.4 Leaderboard & Winnings</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>The bot updates leaderboards following completion of each official match.</li>
                <li>Standings may update near real time and remain subject to verification and correction.</li>
                <li>No entitlement arises from interim standings; confirmed final standings are binding.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>2.5 Time-Zone Reference</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>All official times are stated in UTC.</li>
                <li>Players are responsible for converting UTC to local time.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>2.6 The Habbo Way</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Habbo’s community rules (“The Habbo Way”) apply across all sweepstake-related activity.</li>
                <li>Breaches may result in disciplinary action including removal and forfeiture of prize eligibility.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>2.7 Force-Majeure</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>If the tournament is delayed/cancelled/disrupted, Referees may determine reasonable outcomes, including freezing standings or terminating the event.</li>
                <li>No refunds are issued due to force-majeure delay, suspension, or cancellation.</li>
              </ol>
