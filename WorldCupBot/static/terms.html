          <section id="s2" class="tsec">
            <h2>2. Overview - How It Works</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Entry Fee Collection</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>All participants (“Players”) must pay a one-time, non-recurring entry fee, set as a specified amount of Habbo credits, prior to the stated entry deadline.</li>
              <li>The applicable entry fee amount will be clearly disclosed in advance through the official Google registration form and a pinned message within the server. In the event of any discrepancy, the pinned server message shall prevail.</li>
              <li>Entry fees are pooled to fund the prize pool and may be subject to reasonable tax, platform, or administrative deductions where applicable.</li>
              <li>All Players are required to pay the applicable entry fee in full in order to participate. No discounts, waivers, substitutions, or alternative forms of entry shall be permitted under any circumstances.</li>
              <li>All entry fees are strictly non-refundable once paid, regardless of withdrawal, disqualification, inactivity, or event outcome.</li>
              <li>Entry closes at 23:59 UTC on INPUT DATE. No new Players shall be accepted, and no teams shall be newly assigned, after the official kick-off of the tournament, regardless of payment status or availability.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.2 Team Draw</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Each confirmed Player shall be randomly assigned one (1) national team by the bot following the close of the entry period.</li>
              <li>The randomization and assignment process is fully automated and entirely impartial. No manual intervention, bias, weighting, preference, or selective treatment of any kind shall be applied to any Player at any stage of the process.</li>
              <li>All national teams will be revealed to Players in advance of the tournament. Final team assignment shall be deferred until all forty-eight (48) national teams have been purchased by Players.</li>
              <li>Draw results will be published in a dedicated server channel for transparency and public audit. This publication may include machine-readable data files, including JSON, showing all Player-to-team assignments.</li>
              <li>Publication of the draw, once all forty-eight (48) national teams have been purchased, constitutes official confirmation of assignment.</li>
              <li>Team assignments are final upon publication and may not be swapped, transferred, or reassigned, except through explicitly bot-sanctioned mechanisms defined elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions.</li>
              <li>All teams purchased prior to tournament kick-off shall commence the tournament on equal terms. No Player shall obtain any competitive advantage by reason of the timing or order of purchase, or by owning multiple teams, provided that all forty-eight (48) teams are fully allocated before the opening match.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.3 Team Reveal</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Assigned teams will be revealed to Players via an official Referee announcement embed no later than one (1) week prior to tournament kick-off.</li>
              <li>For visibility within the server, a Player’s Discord nickname may be updated to reflect their assigned team. Such updates are optional, automated where possible, and subject to Discord platform limitations.</li>
              <li>For visibility within the server, a Player’s Discord roles may be updated to reflect their assigned team. Role assignment does not confer moderation privileges or access beyond team identification unless expressly stated elsewhere.</li>
              <li>A direct message will also be sent to each Player confirming their assigned team or teams. Failure to receive a direct message due to user privacy settings, platform limitations, or delivery errors does not invalidate the assignment.</li>
              <li>The Referee announcement and published records shall take precedence over nickname, role, or direct message indicators in the event of any inconsistency.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.4 Leaderboard & Winnings</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>The bot will automatically update the server leaderboard following the completion of each official real-world World Cup match, reflecting team progression and the corresponding Player standings.</li>
              <li>Match results, points allocations, and Player standings will be made available via designated server channels and leaderboard embeds and may be updated in near real time, subject to data availability and processing delays.</li>
              <li>Leaderboard positions are indicative only until the conclusion of the tournament or the relevant competition stage and remain subject to verification, correction, or adjustment in the event of data errors, official result changes, or bot processing issues.</li>
              <li>No Player shall be deemed entitled to any winnings solely on the basis of interim leaderboard positions.</li>
              <li>Final standings and prize allocations, once confirmed and published by the Referees, shall be considered final and binding.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.5 Time-Zone Reference</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>All official dates, deadlines, and times referenced in these Terms and Conditions and in any related server announcements are stated in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).</li>
              <li>Players are solely responsible for converting UTC times into their local time zones. No allowance will be made for missed deadlines resulting from time-zone misinterpretation.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.6 The Habbo Way</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Habbo’s official community rules, commonly referred to as “The Habbo Way”, apply at all times to all Players and participants in connection with the sweepstake, including within Discord servers, direct messages, and any related activities or communications.</li>
              <li>Any behaviour that breaches The Habbo Way, these Terms and Conditions, or applicable platform rules may result in disciplinary action at the discretion of the Referees, including removal from the sweepstake, removal from the server, forfeiture of eligibility for prizes, or other reasonable measures.</li>
              <li>Disciplinary action may be taken regardless of whether the conduct occurs within public channels, private messages, or external interactions that have a demonstrable connection to the sweepstake or its participants.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.7 Force-Majeure</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>In the event that the FIFA World Cup 2026 is postponed, suspended, cancelled, or materially disrupted due to circumstances beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to pandemics, acts of war, natural disasters, governmental actions, or other force-majeure events, Players shall retain their assigned teams and participation status unless otherwise determined by the Referees.</li>
              <li>Where the tournament is delayed or suspended and subsequently resumes, team assignments and standings shall carry forward from the point of interruption unless officially reset or amended by the Referees.</li>
              <li>The prize pool will be held securely during any force-majeure delay. No refunds, reversals, or compensation shall be issued as a result of postponement, suspension, or cancellation arising from force-majeure events.</li>
              <li>If the tournament is permanently cancelled or deemed impracticable to complete, the Referees reserve the right to determine a reasonable resolution, which may include freezing final standings, alternative prize allocation, or event termination without further obligation.</li>

            <h2>3. Joining, Eligibility & Late Entry</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Joining Process</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>To be eligible to participate in the sweepstake, users must satisfy all eligibility requirements and complete the joining steps set out in this Section.</li>
              <li>To be eligible to participate, users must hold an active Habbo account that meets minimum account age and achievement criteria as determined and published by the Referees prior to entry. Accounts deemed inactive, newly created for the purposes of entry, or otherwise ineligible may be refused participation.</li>
              <li>A single Discord user may register a maximum of five (5) entries in the sweepstake.</li>
              <li>The maximum entry limit applies regardless of method of acquisition. A Player may not hold more than five (5) teams in total at any time, whether obtained through initial entry, additional purchases, wait-list assignment, or any other permitted mechanism.</li>
              <li>Users must join the official Discord server (ID: <span class="mono">1385778542792544278</span>) and successfully complete the required verification process.</li>
              <li>Users must complete and submit the official Google registration form, thereby confirming that they have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</li>
              <li>Users must pay the applicable entry fee in full prior to confirmation of participation.</li>
              <li>Participation is confirmed only once the user has received an official confirmation message or embed from the World Cup Bot indicating successful entry into the sweepstake.</li>
              <li>Completion of any individual requirement or step does not guarantee participation unless and until confirmation has been issued in accordance with this Section.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3.2 Wait-List</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Users who seek to participate after the completion of the main team draw may register on a wait-list. Wait-listed users are not required to pay the entry fee unless and until a team becomes available.</li>
              <li>Where a team becomes available due to a Player’s withdrawal or removal prior to the World Cup Final, the team may be offered to the next eligible user on the wait-list.</li>
              <li>An eligible wait-listed user shall have twenty-four (24) hours from notification to accept the offer and pay the required entry fee in full. Failure to do so within this period constitutes forfeiture of the offer without further notice.</li>
              <li>Upon successful acceptance and payment, the wait-listed user shall assume ownership of the team and inherit any points accrued by that team up to the point of reassignment, unless otherwise determined by the Referees.</li>
              <li>Placement on the wait-list does not guarantee participation, team assignment, or entitlement to any points or winnings.</li>
              <li>No wait-list assignment, team reassignment, or new Player entry shall occur after the official kick-off of the tournament, except where necessary to resolve administrative errors identified by the Referees.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3.3 Leaving Early</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>If a Player voluntarily leaves the server or is removed for any reason prior to the World Cup Final, all teams owned by that Player shall be forfeited.</li>
              <li>Forfeited teams shall be dealt with in accordance with the wait-list provisions set out in Section 3.2.</li>
              <li>Any active or pending bets placed by a departing Player shall be automatically voided, unless the Referees expressly determine otherwise.</li>
              <li>Departure, removal, or forfeiture does not entitle the Player to any refund, compensation, or reinstatement.</li>

            <h3>4.1 World Cup Channels</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>World Cup matches and tournament stages may be tracked within designated text channels corresponding to the relevant group or knockout stage (for example, #group-a or #round-of-16).</li>
              <li>Where available, each match or stage text channel may have an associated voice channel intended for watch parties and live match discussion. Availability of voice channels is subject to server capacity and moderation considerations.</li>
              <li>Official match results, team progressions, standings, and leaderboard updates will be posted to the relevant channels by the bot and constitute the primary source of match-related information for the sweepstake.</li>
              <li>Discussion relating to the FIFA World Cup, including matches, teams, standings, and sweepstake activity, shall take place only within the designated World Cup text and voice channels.</li>
              <li>General or non–World Cup discussion must be kept outside the World Cup category (ID: <span class="mono">1385778543958687905</span>) and its corresponding voice category (ID: <span class="mono">1385780380535357622</span>).</li>
              <li>Channel structure, naming conventions, and availability may be modified by the Referees for organisational, moderation, or technical reasons. Such changes shall not affect the validity of match results, standings, or leaderboard outcomes.</li>
              <li>Official match results and tournament data are determined by the FIFA World Cup 2026. Information posted within the server by the bot reflects publicly available FIFA match data and is used for sweepstake administration.</li>
              <li>The Referees may moderate, restrict, or remove messages or users within World Cup channels where necessary to maintain order, accuracy, or compliance with these Terms and Conditions.</li>
              <li>Temporary delays, inaccuracies, or unavailability of channels, embeds, or automated updates due to platform limitations, data latency, or technical issues shall not affect the validity of official FIFA match results, standings, or Player participation.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4.2 Players & Teams Tracking</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>A designated text channel, #players-and-teams, will display a live embed listing all Players and their assigned national teams.</li>
              <li>This record is publicly visible and serves as the authoritative reference for Player-to-team ownership throughout the tournament.</li>
              <li>The information displayed in the #players-and-teams channel shall not be amended except through approved, bot-sanctioned mechanisms expressly provided for in these Terms and Conditions, including permitted team splits.</li>
              <li>Updates to the embed may occur for administrative corrections, system updates, or Referee-approved actions and do not affect the validity of prior assignments or results.</li>

            <h3>5.1 Conduct, Language & Discord Policy</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>All Participants must comply at all times with Discord’s Terms of Service, Discord Community Guidelines, and the specific rules of the World Cup server. This requirement applies to all text channels, voice channels, and direct messages related to the sweepstake.</li>
              <li>Prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to: foul or abusive language, harassment, racism, bigotry, hate speech, discrimination, trolling, spamming, mic abuse, threats, or any behaviour that is disruptive, unsafe, or undermines the integrity of the server or the sweepstake.</li>
              <li>Conduct occurring outside public channels, including in private messages or external interactions, may still be subject to enforcement where it has a demonstrable connection to the server or sweepstake.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>5.2 Gambling & Stakes</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>No real-money gambling is permitted under any circumstances.</li>
              <li>All in-server betting activities or prediction mechanics are strictly limited to virtual items with no real-world monetary value, including but not limited to Habbo credits. No cash, cryptocurrency, gift cards, subscriptions, or real-world goods or services may be used.</li>
              <li>Betting activities or predictions involving politics, discrimination, hate-based themes, or illegal conduct are strictly prohibited and may result in immediate disqualification and enforcement action.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>5.3 Enforcement Actions & Finality</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Where a Participant breaches these Terms and Conditions or server rules, the Referees may take enforcement action at their discretion. Such action may escalate based on the severity, frequency, or intent of the breach and may include, without limitation: Warning → Mute → Team forfeiture → Removal from the server, together with forfeiture of any in-server items, teams, points, or eligibility.</li>
              <li>In cases of serious misconduct, including but not limited to hate speech, doxxing, cheating, or deliberate exploitation of systems or rules, the Referees may bypass any escalation steps and impose immediate penalties, including permanent removal.</li>
              <li>Any dispute relating to an enforcement action must be submitted in writing via direct message to a Referee within twenty-four (24) hours of the relevant incident or decision. Disputes submitted outside this timeframe may be disregarded.</li>
              <li>Decisions made by the Referees under this Section are final and binding. Match results and tournament data posted by the bot, based on official FIFA World Cup information, are not subject to appeal.</li>

              <li>Upon initiation, the bot will notify the current owner via direct message and request confirmation through explicit Accept, Decline, or Confirm actions.</li>
              <li>All split requests, confirmations, and outcomes are logged by the bot. Finalised splits will be published in a designated public channel for transparency.</li>

            <h2>7. Betting Terms</h2>

            <h3>7.1 Bet Creation, Activation & Cancellation</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Any Player or Spectator may propose a bet using the <span class="mono">/makebet</span> command, specifying the wagered virtual items and the available outcome options.</li>
              <li>A bet shall become active only once a second user accepts and claims the opposing outcome through the bot.</li>
              <li>Bets may involve only in-server virtual items with no real-world monetary value, including but not limited to Habbo credits.</li>
              <li>Once a bet is active, it may be cancelled only with the consent of all involved parties and prior to the outcome being decided.</li>
              <li>Requests to cancel an active bet must be submitted via direct message to a Referee. The Referee’s determination on cancellation is final and binding.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
              <li>Bets involving real money, external transactions, cash equivalents, or any items or services with real-world monetary value are strictly prohibited.</li>

              <li>Settlement of bets shall occur once the official result has been confirmed and processed by the bot. Bot-posted outcomes constitute the authoritative determination for bet resolution.</li>
              <li>Bets relating to postponed, abandoned, suspended, or voided matches shall remain unresolved until an official FIFA decision is issued. Where no official resolution is provided, the Referees may determine a reasonable outcome, including bet cancellation.</li>
              <li>Bets may not be reversed, amended, or disputed after settlement, except where a clear administrative or technical error has been identified by the Referees.</li>
              <li>Official FIFA result corrections or post-match rulings shall apply retroactively to unsettled bets. Settled bets shall not be reopened unless the Referees determine that a material error occurred in settlement.</li>

            <ol>

              <li>A Participant who fails to settle a bet may be temporarily or permanently restricted from creating, accepting, or participating in further bets.</li>
              <li>Repeated non-payment, deliberate avoidance, or bad-faith behaviour relating to bet settlement may result in additional enforcement action, including forfeiture of eligibility, removal of teams, or removal from the server.</li>
              <li>Restrictions or penalties imposed under this Section do not relieve the Participant of any outstanding obligations arising from previously settled bets.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>7.5 Bet Clarity & Interpretation</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>All bets must clearly specify the event, outcome conditions, and wagered items at the time of creation.</li>
              <li>Where a bet is ambiguous or unclear, interpretation shall be determined by the Referees, whose decision shall be final.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>7.6 Scope of Betting</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Bets must relate directly to FIFA World Cup 2026 matches, teams, or tournament outcomes.</li>
